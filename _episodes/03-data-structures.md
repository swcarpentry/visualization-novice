title: "Data Structures"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "What are data variables and categories?"
- "What are data values and replicates?"
- "What is the difference between absolute and relative values?"
objectives:
- "To identify data structure features in Gapminder data"
- "To be familiar with differentiating data structures for choosing a good
   chart"
keypoints:
- "'Variables' are associated with columns in tidy data."
- "As a descriptor of a specific column of data, 'variables' tend to describe
  numerically continuous data, while 'categories' describe discrete or
  categorical data that is organized in groups."
- "'Values' are associated with cells in a data table."
- "'Replicates' are values with similar variables and categories most often seen  
  in experimental data."
- "'Absolute' values receive context by their units, while 'relative' values are 
  standardized in some fashion (i.e., proportion, per unit) for comparison among
  categories."

## Data structure is the shape and content of your data.

The shape of your data ought to be rectangular and can be described by the number of rows and columns.

Column in your data can also be called 'variables' or 'fields'. However, the general use of the term 'variable' to describe a column can also be used more specifically to describe numerically continuous data. As a complement to this specific use of 'variables', 'categories' describe discrete or categorical data that can be organized in groups.

'Values' make up the rows of the data and are more specifically associated with
cells in a data table. 'Values' can represent numerical or categorical data.
Numerical values should be recognized as 'absolute' or 'relative'. 'Absolute'
values receive context by their units, while 'relative' values are standardized
in some fashion (i.e., proportion, per unit) and most often used for comparison
among categories.

Rows of data may represent observational or experimental 'replicates'. Most
generally, 'replicates' are values with similar variables and categories that
are evaluated in data analysis.

## Tidy data follows a set of rules.

These rules keep data well organized and ready for analysis.

1. Order doesnâ€™t matter
2. No duplicate rows
3. Every cell contains one value
4. One column per type of information
5. No redundant information
