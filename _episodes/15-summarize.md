## Simple steps to choosing a good chart

1. Identify/define the research question you wish to address.
2. Determine the broad category that describes the goal of your research
   question from [Choosing a Good Chart][good-chart]. 
   - *You may need to redefine
   or focus your research question to better suit visualization.*
3. Follow the decision making tree in [Choosing a Good Chart][good-chart] to
   determine which chart is the most appropriate for addressing your research
   question.
4. Determine the components of the chosen chart that best reveal your conclusion
   of the research question to highlight.

## Use `ggplot2` to develop publication quality figures

The documentation for [`ggplot2`][ggplot] is very helpful for understanding all
of the visualization options available in the package. We have introduced you to
some of the most basic and common options, but the customization opportunities
are endless.
