## Simple steps to choosing a good chart

1. Identify/define the research question you wish to address.
2. Determine the broad category that describes the goal of your research
   question from [Choosing a Good Chart][good-chart]. 
   - *You may need to redefine
   or focus your research question to better suit visualization.*
3. Follow the decision making tree in [Choosing a Good Chart][good-chart] to
   determine which chart is the most appropriate for addressing your research
   question.
4. Determine the components of the chosen chart that best reveal your conclusion
   of the research question to highlight.

## The first example

> ## Our research question is: 
>
> How was the population of Africa distributed across the continent by country
> in 2007?
{: .checklist}

> ## What is its category?
>
> It is a __distribution__. 
{: .solution} 

> ## Is there a single variable? or two variables?
>
> There is __one variable__: `population`.
{: .solution}

> ## Are there few data points? or many?
>
> There are __many data points__. Africa has 52 countries.
{: .solution}

> ## So we choose to make a:
>
> __Line histogram__ or "density plot"
{: .discussion}

## Some practice

> ## Good Chart Challenge
>
> Match the scientific questions with the corresponding graphic on 
> [Choosing a Good Chart][good-chart-labeled].
>
> * A. Distribution: How was the population of Africa distributed across the
>   continent by country in 2007?
> * B. Relationship: What is the relationship of GDP per capita, life
>   expectancy, and population across the world per country in 2007?
> * C. Comparison: How was the world population distributed among continents in
>   2007?
> * D. Composition: How has the composition of the world population among
>   continents changed from 1952-2007?
>
> > ## Answer
> >
> > * A. - C. Line Histogram
> > * B. - F. Bubble Chart
> > * C. - A. Table with Embedded Charts
> > * D. - E. Stacked Area Chart
